# Chapter 4 - [Mastering Go Book](https://packt.link/rUETq)

## Synopsis of Chapter 4: Go Generics

Chapter 4 introduces **Go Generics**, a feature that allows you to write flexible and reusable functions and data structures without sacrificing type safety. Generics were introduced in Go `1.18`, and this chapter dives deep into how to leverage this feature for writing more generic, yet type-safe, code. It covers how to define generic functions, use type parameters, and create constraints that enable generic programming across a variety of data types.

### **Introduction to Generics**

The chapter begins by explaining the motivation behind adding generics to Go. In earlier versions of Go, developers often resorted to using the empty interface (`interface{}`) to create functions that could handle various types. However, this approach sacrifices type safety and can lead to runtime errors. Generics, on the other hand, allow developers to write functions and data structures that can operate on multiple types while ensuring compile-time type safety.

A basic generic function is introduced, showing how type parameters are used in Go. Type parameters are defined using square brackets `[]`, and they allow a function or a type to operate on multiple concrete types. The chapter explains how to define type parameters and how they are passed to functions and types during compilation.

### **Creating Constraints**

One of the key aspects of generics is **constraints**. Constraints define the types that can be used with a generic function or type. The chapter explains how to create custom constraints using Go’s type system. It also introduces the `any` keyword, which is an alias for `interface{}` and can be used to allow a type parameter to accept any type.

The chapter demonstrates how to apply constraints to restrict type parameters to specific sets of types, such as numeric types. This ensures that generic functions can still leverage Go’s type safety by limiting the operations that can be performed on type parameters. Built-in Go types, such as numbers or slices, are often used as constraints in real-world scenarios.

### **Supporting Slices and Data Types with Generics**

One of the most common use cases for generics in Go is writing functions that work with **slices** of any data type. The chapter illustrates how to write a generic function that can work with slices of any type, whether they contain integers, strings, or even custom structs. The chapter also covers how to use type assertions and type switches to handle cases where more control over types is needed within a generic function.

A key example is shown with a generic function that operates on a slice of any type, such as sorting or filtering the slice. This demonstrates how generics make it possible to write more flexible and reusable code while still maintaining strict type constraints.

### **Using Generics in Structs**

The chapter also explains how to use generics in defining new types, such as **structs**. Generic structs allow developers to create data structures that can store and manipulate values of various types without duplicating code. This concept is extended to Go’s standard library packages like `cmp` and `slices`, which implement generic functions for comparing and manipulating slices and maps.

### **When to Use Generics**

While generics bring flexibility, the chapter emphasizes that they should be used judiciously. Go is designed to be simple and readable, and generics can introduce complexity when overused. The chapter advises on when it’s appropriate to use generics and when sticking to traditional type-specific functions is preferable.
