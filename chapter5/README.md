# Chapter 5 - [Mastering Go Book](https://packt.link/rUETq)

## Synopsis of Chapter 5: Reflection and Interfaces

Chapter 5 explores two advanced concepts: **reflection** and **interfaces**. These topics are central to building flexible and reusable code in Go. While interfaces enable polymorphism and abstraction, reflection allows Go programs to inspect and manipulate variables, types, and functions at runtime. This chapter delves into how these concepts work and how to apply them effectively in real-world applications.

### **Reflection in Go**

The chapter begins with an introduction to **reflection**, which is the ability of a program to inspect its own structure during runtime. Reflection in Go is made possible through the `reflect` package, which provides tools to work with types, values, and methods dynamically. Reflection is powerful but should be used with caution due to its complexity and potential performance impacts.

The chapter explains how to use the `reflect.TypeOf()` and `reflect.ValueOf()` functions to obtain the type and value of a variable at runtime. These functions allow Go programs to inspect the kind of data they are dealing with, such as determining whether a variable is an integer, a string, or a slice. The **three laws of reflection** are discussed to help developers understand the relationships between types, values, and interfaces.

Examples are provided that show how to use reflection to iterate over the fields of a struct, change values at runtime, and invoke methods dynamically. One of the practical applications highlighted is how reflection is used in libraries such as JSON marshaling/unmarshaling, where types must be dynamically inspected.

### **Disadvantages of Reflection**

While reflection is a powerful tool, the chapter emphasizes its drawbacks. Reflection can be slower than direct method calls, as it bypasses Go's type system and incurs runtime costs. Additionally, code that uses reflection can be harder to read and maintain. The chapter advises developers to use reflection only when necessary and to prefer statically typed solutions when possible.

### **Go Interfaces**

The chapter then transitions to **interfaces**, one of Go’s most defining features. An interface in Go defines a set of methods, and any type that implements those methods satisfies the interface, enabling polymorphism. Interfaces allow Go programs to define behaviors without specifying how those behaviors are implemented.

The chapter explains how interfaces are declared, how types implement interfaces, and how Go’s **implicit interface satisfaction** (no need for explicit declaration) simplifies code. One of the primary benefits of interfaces is that they enable the use of **duck typing**: "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck."

Several practical examples of interfaces are provided, including how they are used in Go’s standard library. The chapter also covers **empty interfaces** (`interface{}`), which can accept any type and are frequently used in situations requiring flexibility, such as data serialization or logging.

### **Type Assertions and Type Switches**

A key part of working with interfaces is **type assertions** and **type switches**. Type assertions allow you to extract the concrete type from an interface, while type switches let you handle different types dynamically. This is particularly useful when working with empty interfaces.

Examples of type assertions and type switches are provided, demonstrating how they enable Go programs to perform type-specific operations on interface values without sacrificing safety.

### **Sort Interface and Custom Sorting**

The chapter also covers the **`sort.Interface`**, a standard interface in Go used to implement custom sorting algorithms for slices. It shows how to define and implement the methods required by `sort.Interface` to sort a slice of custom structs.

### **Reflection vs. Interfaces**

Finally, the chapter compares the use cases for reflection and interfaces, stressing that while both offer flexibility, interfaces are the preferred method for abstraction in Go due to their simplicity and type safety. Reflection should be reserved for scenarios where interface-based polymorphism is insufficient.
