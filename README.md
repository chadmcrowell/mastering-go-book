4. **[CHAPTER 4](chapter4/README.md): Go Generics**
   - Develop a function using Go generics that works with slices of any type.
   - Create constraints for a custom data type and apply them to a generic function.

5. **[CHAPTER 5](chapter5/README.md): Reflection and Interfaces**
   - Create a slice of structures, sort them based on a specific field.

   - Write a program that reads text files character by character.
   - Create a command-line utility that works with JSON configurations.

8. **[CHAPTER 8](chapter8/README.md): Go Concurrency**
   - Develop a program that creates multiple goroutines and ensures they complete before proceeding.
   - Implement worker pools using channels.

9. **[CHAPTER 9](chapter9/README.md): Building Web Services**

    - Create metrics for a Go server and expose them to Prometheus.

14. **[CHAPTER 14](chapter14/README.md): Efficiency and Performance**
    - Create a function that copies binary files, benchmark different implementations to find the fastest one.

15. **[CHAPTER 15](chapter15/README.md): Changes in Recent Go Versions**
    - Experiment with the new features introduced in Go 1.21 and 1.22, such as `sync.OnceFunc()`.

16. **[APPENDIX](Appendix/README.md): The Go Garbage Collector**
    - Several important features that make Garbage collection efficient and reliable.
    - A detailed explanation of the **tri-color algorithm**.
    - How Goâ€™s GC interacts with **maps** and **slices**.
